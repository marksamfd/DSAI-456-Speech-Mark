# Assignment 2

## Reading 

- Read Sections 14.5 from the main book 
- Watch videos 5,6, and 16 from the _Audio Signal Processing for ML_ tutorial 

## Implementation 

Write  python program to perform the following tasks: 
- Record or use given speech audio samples
- Compute the frequency spectrum of the speech signals using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- Plot the frequency spectrum as well as the original waveform along with the sinusoidal components
- Identify and discuss dominant frequencies and fundamental frequency (F0) for different spoken words or phonemes
- Generate spectrograms by applying Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) on speech signals
- Plot the spectrogram along with the spoken words (each word is written under each block in spectrogram)
- Plot and interpret spectrograms and discuss formant patterns and phoneme distinctions
- Explore different window sizes and overlaps and analyze their effect on time-frequency resolution
