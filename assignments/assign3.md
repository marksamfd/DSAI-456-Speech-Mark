**Comparative Analysis of Male and Female Speech Using Mel Spectrograms and Mel Filter Banks**

Let's assume that you are provided with two audio files: one recording of a male speaker and one recording of a female speaker speaking the exact same short sentence "_the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog_".

1. Records this sentence twice, once by a male and once by a female.
2. Load both audio files and preprocess them as needed.
3. Compute the Mel spectrograms of both audio signals.
4. Extract and visualize the Mel filter banks used in the spectrogram computation.
5. Compare the Mel spectrograms of the male and female speakers by analyzing differences in spectral energy distribution, fundamental frequency (F0) regions, and formant patterns.
6. Discuss the acoustic differences evident in the Mel spectrograms.
7. Reflect on how such spectral differences are relevant to speech recognition and speaker identification systems.
