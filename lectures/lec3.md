# Mel to the Rescue 

:: left :: 

- Designed to match human perception of pitch: how humans _perceive_ sound at different frequencies
- Equal intervals in mels represent equal perceived distances between pitches to a human listener
- The scale is anchored at 1000 Hz being equal to 1000 mels
- Below approximately 500 Hz, the mel and Hz scales are roughly equivalent

  $mel(f) = 2595 \log(1+\frac{f}{700})$

# Frequency Spectrum to Mel Spectrum

:: content :: 

- Mel channels (bands) are equally spaced points between lower/upper mels
- A series of triangular filters are created, with each filter centered at a point on the Mel scale
- Each filter captures the energy within its respective frequency band

# Frequency Spectrum to Mel Spectrum

:: content :: 

- Each filter captures the energy within its respective frequency band
- The scalar output from each filter is called a _channel (band)_
- The output for each input frame from the filter bank is a vector, represents the log energy of (mel-spaced) frequency bands
