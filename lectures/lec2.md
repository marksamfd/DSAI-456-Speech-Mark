# Frequency Bands

:: content :: 

- Phones have characteristic spectral _signatures (Spectral peaks)_

- Inner ear computes the spectrum of the incoming waveform

- Spectrogram for three vowels
  
![](./images/lec2-freq-sinewaves6.png)

<!-- dark is more important because amplitude for white region is almost zero -->
<!-- which frequency range the dark area is -->

- Each dark bar is called a **formant** which is a frequency band that is particularly amplified by the vocal tract

# Issues with Hz

- Human hearing is less sensitive at higher frequencies
- The difference at low frequencies 50 Hz to 550 Hz is a massive change in perceived pitch
- However, the difference at high frequencies 13kHz to 15kHz is not a significant change in perceived pitch

- Information in low frequencies (like formants) is crucial for distinguishing vowels or nasals
- Modeling this human perceptual property improves speech recognition performance in the same way

# Mel to the Rescue 

:: left :: 

- Designed to match human perception of pitch: how humans _perceive_ sound at different frequencies
- Equal intervals in mels represent equal perceived distances between pitches to a human listener
- The scale is anchored at 1000 Hz being equal to 1000 mels
- Below approximately 500 Hz, the mel and Hz scales are roughly equivalent

  $mel(f) = 2595 \log(1+\frac{f}{700})$
